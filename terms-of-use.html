            not exceed the greater of the fees you paid to pursuant to this agreement over the twelve (12) months
            preceding the incident giving rise to such liability. Because some jurisdictions do not allow certain

            particular circumstance any limitation on damages or liability set forth herein is prohibited by applicable
            law, then, instead of the provisions hereof in such particular circumstance, the Company and/or its

            <br><br>
            There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an
            arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and
            declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court
            would.

            provided written notice for settlement thereof shall be referred to arbitration of sole arbitrator jointly,
            appointed by the parties under the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996. The arbitration

            the laws of India. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The costs and expenses of the
            arbitration shall be borne as decided pursuant to the award.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these terms shall be unlawful, void or for any reason
            unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the
            validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Survival:</strong> The provisions of these terms, which by their nature should survive the
            termination of these terms, shall survive such termination.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Waiver:</strong> No waiver of any provision of these terms by us shall be deemed a further or
            continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or provision
            under these terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Assignment:</strong> These Terms of Service, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not
            be transferred, or assigned by you, but may be assigned by the Company without restriction.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Force Majeure:</strong> The Company&rsquo;s performance of its obligations under this Contract will
            be suspended for so long as the Company is prevented from doing so by an Event of Force Majeure. "Event of
            Force Majeure" shall mean such events or circumstances, which are beyond the control of the Company and
            which events could not have been reasonably foreseen or anticipated by the Company upon the exercise of due
            care and diligence, including but not limited to Ohilo App or Website&rsquo;s operations being materially
            impaired, hampered, interrupted, prevented, suspended, postponed or discontinued due to the acts of God,
            earthquake, floods, riots, lockouts, war, civil disturbance, fire, accidents, armed conflict etc. government
            order or regulation, judicial order or decree (including without limitation injunctive relief, whether
            imposed on an industry wide basis or affecting the Company), failure of technical facilities or substantial
            impairment in obtaining facilities which makes the rendering of Ohilo App beyond the Company&rsquo;s
            control.
            <br><br>
            We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not
            in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than
            in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in
            court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
